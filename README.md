# OpenTab:
**A replacement for your browser's cluttered and invasive new-tab page.**

## About
Just a side project of mine, just an example of what browsers should strive for with a new tab page. A replacement for the standard browser new tab. OpenTab aims to make searching more productive and efficient, so that you always are searching where you want with a single query.

1. Prioritize the user's search: The users know what they want to look for, and where they want to look for it. Tracking users to try to predict what they want is invasive and distracting. Let the users search what and where they want.
2. Modern: Keep the visuals pleasing and not distracting. Sharp visual changes and cluttered icons cause eye strain and just slow the user down.
3. Fast: No tracking, no indexing of pages, just search and you're on your way.

## How to Use
**Chromium-Based** Go to <a href="chrome://flags/#custom-ntp">chrome://flags/#custom-ntp</a> and set the address to OpenTab's url (after customizing colors, if desired).
